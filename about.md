_Ethical Web Development_ is a project by [Adam Scott](http://adamscott.website/). The project consists of this site and a series of short digital books that explore the ethics of practical development topics. The books will be released throughout 2016 and early 2017 as free downloads from [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/). They are being actively written [in the open on GitHub](https://github.com/ascott1/ethical-web-dev). I welcome contributions and comments.
