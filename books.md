Many users own outdated computers with older browsers, have slow connections, or struggle with physical disabilities that prevent them from accessing today’s sites and apps. How do you strike a balance in your design to include everyone?

This title explores best practices for using progressive enhancement, accessibility, and inclusive web forms in our applications.

As the Web continues to play an increasingly large role in our daily lives, these features will help our sites to fulfill Tim Berners-Lee’s promise of a global communication network that enables everyone with a connection to participate fully.

Many people around the world who can’t afford high-speed Internet—or have slow, unreliable connections—often resort to smartphones with restrictive data plans just to take care of basics such as banking or job hunting. How can you build sites that work everywhere, on every network?

This title explores how resource-heavy websites limit the options for millions of users and shows you what you can do to make your sites and apps more inclusive through exposing permanent, human-readable links, utilizing responsive web design, focusing on web performance, and including offline capabilities.

As the Web continues to play an increasingly large role in our daily lives, these features will help our sites to fulfill Tim Berners-Lee’s promise of a global communication network that enables people to participate fully, no matter what connection they use.

A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that few Americans are confident about the security or privacy of their data—particularly when it comes to the use of online tools. Each of us now produces more data every day than people in earlier generations did throughout their lifetimes. Every time we click, tweet, or visit a site, we leave a digital trace. As a web developers, we represent the first line of defense in protecting our user’s data and privacy.

This title explores several techniques, tools, and best practices for developing and maintaining web apps that provide the privacy and security that every user needs—and deserves.
